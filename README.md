MVP for “Party Planner Buddy” 

The Party Planner Buddy app will take in the number of guests in an upcoming party from the visiting user/guest. They will then input their budget in the space provided. Then, a list of party supplies they can rent/or buy for the party will be listed with the prices per item. As you click on each item to add to your shopping list, the sum of the items chosen will be displayed so you know if you are within budget or not.

Basic MVP
- As a user, upon loading the app I can clearly see where I need to navigate to in order to begin planning for my party. 
- After a brief summary of the instructions at the top of the page an input field will be displayed and awaiting the user to enter the number of guests
- Below the guest input their budget of the party. 
- Down below the inputs we will have the budget they entered and will be displayed above the list of items you can buy/rent for your party
- There will be a list next to it that will be your shopping cart and above that list will be the total price of your shopping cart

STRETCH MVP (I know, it doesn’t make sense)
Alert the user if their total goes above budget 
Allow the user to remove items from list

USER STORIES:
- As a developer I can create a React App with App.js as my main component

- As a developer I can use the parrallax effect on our background image as we scroll

- As a developer I can create the NumberOfGuest Component that allows the user to type in ONLY numbers and display that quantity on the screen in real time

- As a developer I can create a Budget component that allows the user to type ONLY numbers and display their budget on the screen in real time

- As a developer I can create two columns, on the left will be the ListOfItems component that houses all item names, prices, and quantities. They will have "add to cart" buttons

- As a developer I can create a ItemCart component for the right hand column. Once a user clicks add to cart, the list on the right will autopopulate that item in the list automatically. It will also add up the sum of money for all items added to cart

- As a developer I can create an empty cart button that will reset the cart to empty and the sum to $0







This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
